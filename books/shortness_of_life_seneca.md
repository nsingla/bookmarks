* To have peace in prosperity and patience in adversity 
* No activity can be pursued by an individual who is preoccupied
* The mind when distracted absorbs nothing deeply, but rejects everything that crams into it
* Living is the least important activity of a preoccupied man
* The man who spends all his time on his own needs, who organizes everyday as though it were his last, neither longs for nor fears the next day  
* The problem is not that we have a short life, but that we waste time
* We are never content and happy with life, and in the end we think it is short. We must start living today
* The preoccupied find life very short 
* Life is divided into past, present and future. Of these, the present is short, the future is doubtful, the past is certain
* Life is very short and anxious for those who forget the past, neglect the present, and fear the future. When they come to the end of it, the poor wretches realize too late that for all this time they have been preoccupied in doing nothing
* To preserve prosperity, we need other prosperity. Whatever comes by chance is unsteady, and the higher it rises the more liable it is to fall
* Life will be driven  on through a succession of preoccupations : we shall always long for leisure, but never enjoy it
* It is disgraceful to see a man collapsing in the middle of his duties, worn out more by his life-style than by his labours
* A lot of people have the feeling where the desire for their work outlasts their ability to do it
* Prosperity doesnâ€™t elevate the sage and adversity does not depress him
* The man who restrains himself within the bounds set by nature will not notice poverty; the man who exceeds these bounds will be pursued by poverty  however rich he is
* If a man stirs himself to face the worst disasters and defeats the evils which overwhelm others, then he wears those very sorrows like a sacred badge
* It is better to conquer our grief than to deceive it. For if it has withdrawn, being merely beguiled by pleasures and preoccupations, it starts up again and from its very respite gains force to savage us. But the grief that has been conquered by reason is calmed forever
